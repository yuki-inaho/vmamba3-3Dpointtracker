# THE PROBLEM. torch ships its own cuDNN inside the venv, but that wheel does not carry every engine
# sub-library. cuDNN's dispatcher dlopens the missing one regardless, finds the host's copy under
# /usr/lib, and refuses the mixture with CUDNN_STATUS_SUBLIBRARY_VERSION_MISMATCH; every convolution
# then fails, which cudnn_guard.py works around by disabling cuDNN entirely -- correct but slow.
# Concretely on this host: torch bundles 9.20, which has no libcudnn_engines_tensor_ir, and the
# system ships 9.25 which does. /proc/self/maps showed five cuDNN libraries loaded from the venv and
# exactly one from /usr, and that one was the mismatch.
#
# THE FIX. Put a COMPLETE cuDNN matching the SYSTEM version ahead of the bundled one on the loader
# path, so every sub-library comes from one release. No sudo, no torch change, no lockfile change.
#
# WHY NOT UPGRADE THE VENV'S nvidia-cudnn-cu13 INSTEAD. torch pins an exact cuDNN, and asking for a
# newer one makes the resolver downgrade torch itself (2.12.1 -> 2.10.0 here) and swap the whole CUDA
# stack, which would invalidate every measurement. That was tried, and reverted.
#
# NOT A SPEED FIX. A correct stack is worth having and costs nothing, but it does not make these jobs
# fast: measured on WAFT track generation, 32.7 s/clip with cuDNN against 35.4 without, about 1.08x.
# An earlier claim of 15.8x was wrong -- it read tqdm's instantaneous rate over a stretch where most
# clips were already on disk and skipped without work.
#
# THE VERSION IS DETECTED, NOT HARDCODED. An apt upgrade that moves the system cuDNN silently
# reintroduces the mismatch under a hardcoded path, and the symptom is a slow job rather than an
# error, so it would go unnoticed. If no matching wheel is present this says so, prints the exact
# command to fetch one, and lets the job run on the no-cuDNN fallback.
